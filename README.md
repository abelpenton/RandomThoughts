The idea with this app is that the users express themselves with an open mind.

They can talk about their day, their work, music, their feelings, about anything.

The idea came to me because the other day I was reading about how to overcome the stress. One technique that the article mention was about writing, like in a personal diary. So I thought, well, what about having an online diary where I can write and have these writings in one place that I can access them and write them from anywhere?

Also, what about if when I write I could specify my mood, so the app can recommend me some actions to improve my mood if it is not good or give me some kind of reward when it is good to encourage me to keep going with the good mood.

Well, because when we are having some issues with our mind sometimes we need to talk to our friends about it or even go to see a specialist, what about receiving advice from anyone even if we don't know them?? Of course, because it might be users with bad advice and other with good ones, it could be useful that the users have some kind of global Reputation based on the quality of their comments and thoughts (I think that maybe the users could have Reputation if they provide helpful comments and another point system for the popularity of their thoughts).

To write more about the app....
